(Making a change from the cloned repo)
# Student GitLab Project

This project was created as part of the Git assignment for practicing basic and advanced Git concepts. The main aim of this project is to understand how Git works locally, how it connects to remote repositories, and how branching and merging are handled in real projects.

The project starts with a simple setup using HTML and CSS and is gradually extended to demonstrate different Git operations such as commits, branches, merges, rebasing, and GitFlow workflow.

## Project Files

The repository contains the following files:

- `README.md` – Describes the project and its purpose  
- `index.html` – A basic HTML page created in the initial setup  
- `styles.css` – Contains basic styling used by the HTML pages  
- `.gitignore` – Used to ignore log files and temporary folders  
- `config.py` – A template file showing how configuration details can be separated from code  
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` – Documentation explaining the Git workflow followed in this project  

Additional HTML and JavaScript files were added in different branches to demonstrate feature development and bug fixing.
